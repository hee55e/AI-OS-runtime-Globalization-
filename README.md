# AI OS Runtime Globalization
Building an ecosystem for the era of individual sovereignty.

## North Star
KAIT aims to be an AI OS runtime that lets each user assemble, operate, and evolve their own AI system without being locked to a single frontend, provider, or deployment shape.

## Runtime Pillars
- Segment-based streaming for precise real-time interaction and rendering.
- User-owned runtime state (sessions, configs, and local-first data patterns such as SQLite profiles).
- Dual UX model for both power users and lightweight users.
- First-class observability: logs, debug traces, and replay-friendly execution metadata.
- Plugin-native architecture across processors, filters, handlers, connectors, and tools.
- Graph-first orchestration with no hard cap on workflow complexity.
- Frontend-agnostic runtime contract for web, desktop, and custom clients.
- Built-in Studio + IDE capabilities for authoring and operations.
- Tool/handler extensibility with MCP interoperability.
- Trigger-driven proactive automation (event-first execution).
- Stable recursion flow and bounded agent loops.
- Multi-surface product model: Studio, IDE, Chat, and CLI.
- Multi-transport compatibility: SSE, WebSocket, and RTC-oriented integrations.
- HITL reliability and reproducibility as a core safety baseline.
- Deployment portability with profile-based isolation for cloud/client/local environments.

## Practical Product Shape
KAIT should feel like one runtime with many interfaces:
- UI users operate through Studio.
- AI operators can execute the same intent through CLI-compatible workflows.
- Teams can bind context-specific AIs (graph, gallery, browser, plugin, etc.) while keeping one coherent runtime contract.

## Current Reality (Sync Notes)
- Core graph orchestration, segment streaming, and registry-based extensibility are implemented.
- Some experiences are intentionally in-progress (for example, unified onboarding flow and full primary-AI control plane).
- This README describes the target operating model; implementation details must always be validated against code.
